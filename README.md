# AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator

This system takes an unstructured text document, and uses an LLM of your choice to extract knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, and visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.
A demo of a knowlege graph created with this project can be found here: [Industrial-Revolution Knowledge Graph](https://robert-mcdermott.github.io/ai-knowledge-graph/)


## Features

- **Text Chunking**: Automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Uses AI to identify entities and their relationships
- **Entity Standardization**: Ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks
- **Relationship Inference**: Discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph
- **Interactive Visualization**: Creates an interactive graph visualization
- **Works with Any OpenAI Compatible API Endpoint**: Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, vLLM, LiteLLM (provides access to AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic and many other LLM services)

## How It Works

1. **Chunking**: The document is split into overlapping chunks to fit within the LLM's context window
2. **First Pass - SPO Extraction**: 
   - Each chunk is processed by the LLM to extract Subject-Predicate-Object triplets
   - Implemented in the `process_with_llm` function
   - The LLM identifies entities and their relationships within each text segment
   - Results are collected across all chunks to form the initial knowledge graph
3. **Second Pass - Entity Standardization**:
   - Basic standardization through text normalization
   - Optional LLM-assisted entity alignment (controlled by `standardization.use_llm_for_entities` config)
   - When enabled, the LLM reviews all unique entities from the graph and identifies groups that refer to the same concept
   - This resolves cases where the same entity appears differently across chunks (e.g., "AI", "artificial intelligence", "AI system")
   - Standardization helps create a more coherent and navigable knowledge graph
4. **Third Pass - Relationship Inference**:
   - Automatic inference of transitive relationships
   - Optional LLM-assisted inference between disconnected graph components (controlled by `inference.use_llm_for_inference` config)
   - When enabled, the LLM analyzes representative entities from disconnected communities and infers plausible relationships
   - This reduces graph fragmentation by adding logical connections not explicitly stated in the text
   - Both rule-based and LLM-based inference methods work together to create a more comprehensive graph
5. **Visualization**: An interactive HTML visualization is generated using the PyVis library

Both the second and third passes are optional and can be disabled in the configuration to minimize LLM usage or control these processes manually.

## Visualization Features

- **Color-coded Communities**: Node colors represent different communities
- **Node Size**: Nodes sized by importance (degree, betweenness, eigenvector centrality)
- **Relationship Types**: Original relationships shown as solid lines, inferred relationships as dashed lines
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom, pan, hover for details, filtering and physics controls
- **Light (default) and Dark mode themes**.

## Program Flow Description

1. **Entry Point**: The program starts in `main.py` which parses command-line arguments.

2. **Mode Selection**:
   - If `--test` flag is provided, it generates a sample visualization
   - Otherwise, it processes the input text file

3. **Configuration**: Loads settings from `config.toml` using `config.py`

4. **Text Processing**:
   - Breaks text into chunks with overlap using `text_utils.py`
   - Processes each chunk with the LLM to extract triples
   - Uses prompts from `prompts.py` to guide the LLM's extraction process

5. **Entity Standardization** (optional):
   - Standardizes entity names across all triples
   - May use LLM for entity resolution in ambiguous cases
   - Uses specialized prompts from `prompts.py` for entity resolution

6. **Relationship Inference** (optional):
   - Identifies communities in the graph
   - Infers relationships between disconnected communities
   - Applies transitive inference and lexical similarity rules
   - Uses specialized prompts from `prompts.py` for relationship inference
   - Deduplicates triples

7. **Visualization**:
   - Calculates centrality metrics and community detection
   - Determines node sizes and colors based on importance
   - Creates an interactive HTML visualization using PyVis
   - Customizes the HTML with templates

8. **Output**:
   - Saves the knowledge graph as both HTML and JSON
   - Displays statistics about nodes, edges, and communities
